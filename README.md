# 🔐 Zero Trust Threat Modeling Dashboard

**A Python-based simulation dashboard for cyber threat modeling aligned with Zero Trust Architecture.**

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project generates realistic cybersecurity data and visualizes it through the lens of Zero Trust principles. It’s built for analysts, engineers, and CISOs looking to prototype, simulate, or train on threat modeling techniques mapped to modern Zero Trust architectures.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧪 Simulated threat modeling using MITRE ATT&CK
- 💻 Fake asset inventory generation
- 🔐 Mapping of controls and threats to Zero Trust pillars (identity, device, network, etc.)
- 📊 CSV-backed datasets and Pandas DataFrames for analysis
- ⚙️ Modular Python structure — plug and play more data generators
- 🎯 Designed for future integration with:
  - Threat Intelligence Feeds
  - SIEM Platforms
  - CMDBs
  - Security Control Dashboards
